The `departure_time` must be set to the current time or some time in the future. It cannot be in the past.\n\n<div class=\"note\">Note: If departure time is not specified, choice of route and duration are based on road network and average time-independent traffic conditions.

Waypoints alter a route by directing it through the specified location(s). The API supports waypoints for these travel modes: driving, walking and bicycling; not transit.   You can supply one or more locations separated by the pipe character (`|` or `%7C`), in the form of a place ID, an address, or latitude/longitude coordinates. By default, the Directions service calculates a route using the waypoints in the order they are given. The precedence for parsing the value of the waypoint is place ID, latitude/longitude coordinates, then address.\n* If you pass a place ID, you must prefix it with `place_id:`. You can retrieve place IDs from the Geocoding API and the Places API (including Place Autocomplete). For an example using place IDs from Place Autocomplete, see [Place Autocomplete and Directions](/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/places-autocomplete-directions). For more about place IDs, see the [Place ID overview](/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-id).\n  <div class=\"note\">For efficiency and accuracy, use place ID's when possible. These ID's are uniquely explicit like a lat/lng value pair and provide geocoding benefits for routing such as access points and traffic variables. Unlike an address, ID's do not require the service to perform a search or an intermediate request for place details; therefore, performance is better.</div>\n* If you pass latitude/longitude coordinates, the values go directly to the front-end server to calculate directions without geocoding. The points are snapped to roads and might not provide the accuracy your app needs. Use coordinates when you are confident the values truly specify the points your app needs for routing without regard to possible access points or additional geocoding details. Ensure that a comma (`%2C`) and not a space (`%20`) separates the latitude and longitude values.\n* If you pass an address, the Directions service will geocode the string and convert it into latitude/longitude coordinates to calculate directions. If the address value is ambiguous, the value might evoke a search to disambiguate from similar addresses. For example, \"1st Street\" could be a complete value or a partial value for \"1st street NE\" or \"1st St SE\". This result may be different from that returned by the Geocoding API. You can avoid possible misinterpretations using place IDs.\n* Alternatively, you can supply an encoded set of points using the [Encoded Polyline Algorithm](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylinealgorithm). You will find an encoded set is useful for a large number of waypoints, because the URL is significantly shorter. All web services have a URL limit of 8192 characters.\n  * Encoded polylines must be prefixed with `enc:` and followed by a colon (`:`). For example: `waypoints=enc:gfo}EtohhU:`.\n  * You can also include multiple encoded polylines, separated by the pipe character (`|`). For example, `waypoints=via:enc:wc~oAwquwMdlTxiKtqLyiK:|enc:c~vnAamswMvlTor@tjGi}L:| via:enc:udymA{~bxM:`\n\n##### Influence routes with stopover and pass through points\n\nFor each waypoint in the request, the directions response appends an entry to the `legs` array to provide the details for stopovers on that leg of the journey.\n\nIf you'd like to influence the route using waypoints without adding a stopover, add the prefix `via:` to the waypoint. Waypoints prefixed with `via:` will not add an entry to the `legs` array, but will route the journey through the waypoint.\n\nThe following URL modifies the previous request such that the journey is routed through Lexington without stopping:\n\n```\nhttps://maps.gomaps.pro/maps/api/directions/json?\norigin=Boston,MA&destination=Concord,MA\n&waypoints=Charlestown,MA|via:Lexington,MA  \n```\n\nThe `via:` prefix is most effective when creating routes in response to the user dragging the waypoints on the map. Doing so allows the user to see how the final route may look in real-time and helps ensure that waypoints are placed in locations that are accessible to the Directions API.\n\n<div class=\"caution\">Caution: Using the `via:` prefix to avoid stopovers results in directions that are strict in their interpretation of the waypoint. This interpretation may result in severe detours on the route or `ZERO_RESULTS` in the response status code if the Directions API is unable to create directions through that point.</div>\n\n\n##### Optimize your waypoints\n\nBy default, the Directions service calculates a route through the provided waypoints in their given order. Optionally, you may pass `optimize:true` as the first argument within the waypoints parameter to allow the Directions service to optimize the provided route by rearranging the waypoints in a more efficient order. (This optimization is an application of the traveling salesperson problem.) Travel time is the primary factor which is optimized, but other factors such as distance, number of turns and many more may be taken into account when deciding which route is the most efficient. All waypoints must be stopovers for the Directions service to optimize their route.\n\nIf you instruct the Directions service to optimize the order of its waypoints, their order will be returned in the `waypoint_order` field within the routes object. The `waypoint_order` field returns values which are zero-based.\n\nThe following example calculates a road journey from Adelaide, South Australia to each of South Australia's main wine regions using route optimization.\n\n```\nhttps://maps.gomaps.pro/maps/api/directions/json?\norigin=Adelaide,SA&destination=Adelaide,SA\n&waypoints=optimize:true|Barossa+Valley,SA|Clare,SA|Connawarra,SA|McLaren+Vale,SA\n```\n\nInspection of the calculated route will indicate that calculation uses waypoints in the following waypoint order:\n\n```\n\"waypoint_order\": [ 3, 2, 0, 1 ]\n```\n\n<div class=\"caution\">Caution: Requests using waypoint optimization are billed at a higher rate. <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/maps/billing-and-pricing/pricing#directions-advanced\">Learn more about how GoMaps.pro Maps Platform products are billed.</a></div>\n",

With the Elevation API, you can develop hiking and biking applications, positioning applications, or low resolution surveying applications.\n\nElevation data is available for all locations on the surface of the earth, including depth locations on the ocean floor (which return negative values). In those cases where GoMaps.pro does not possess exact elevation measurements at the precise location you request, the service interpolates and returns an averaged value using the four nearest locations. Elevation values are expressed relative to local mean sea level (LMSL).\n\nRequests to the Elevation API utilize different parameters based on whether the request is for discrete locations or for an ordered path. For discrete locations, requests for elevation return data on the specific locations passed in the request; for paths, elevation requests are instead sampled along the given path."

You can find code information at Wikipedia: List of ISO 3166 country codes or the ISO Online Browsing Platform.</aside>\n  \nThe following components may be used to influence results, but will not be enforced:\n\n* `route` matches the long or short name of a route.\n* `locality` matches against `locality` and `sublocality` types.\n* `administrative_area` matches all the `administrative_area` levels.\n  \nNotes about component filtering:\n\n* Do not repeat these component filters in requests, or the API will return `INVALID_REQUEST`: \n  * `country`\n  * `postal_code`\n  * `route`\n* If the request contains repeated component filters, the API evaluates those filters as an AND, not an OR.\n* Results are consistent with GoMaps.pro Maps, which occasionally yields unexpected `ZERO_RESULTS` responses. Using Place Autocomplete may provide better results in some use cases. To learn more, see [this FAQ](https://developers..google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/faq#trbl_component_filtering).\n* For each address component, either specify it in the address parameter or in a components filter, but not both.

A note about processing: The `result_type` parameter does not restrict the search to the specified address type(s). Rather, the `result_type` acts as a post-search filter: the API fetches all results for the specified `latlng`, then discards those results that do not match the specified address type(s).The following values are supported:\n* `administrative_area_level_1` indicates a first-order civil entity below the country level. Within the United States, these administrative levels are states. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels. In most cases, administrative_area_level_1   * `short` names will closely match ISO 3166-2 subdivisions and other widely circulated lists; however this is not guaranteed as our geocoding results are based on a variety of signals and location data.\n* `administrative_area_level_2` indicates a second-order civil entity below the country level. Within the United States, these administrative levels are counties. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels.\n* `administrative_area_level_3` indicates a third-order civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels.\n* `administrative_area_level_4` indicates a fourth-order civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels.\n* `administrative_area_level_5` indicates a fifth-order civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels.\n* `airport` indicates an airport.\n* `colloquial_area` indicates a commonly-used alternative name for the entity.\n* `country` indicates the national political entity, and is typically the highest order type returned by the Geocoder.\n* `intersection` indicates a major intersection, usually of two major roads.\n* `locality` indicates an incorporated city or town political entity.\n* `natural_feature` indicates a prominent natural feature.\n* `neighborhood` indicates a named neighborhood\n* `park` indicates a named park.\n* `plus_code` indicates an encoded location reference, derived from latitude and longitude. Plus codes can be used as a replacement for street addresses in places where they do not exist (where buildings are not numbered or streets are not named). See [https://plus.codes/](https://plus.codes/) for details.\n* `point_of_interest` indicates a named point of interest. Typically, these \"POI\"s are prominent local entities that don't easily fit in another category, such as \"Empire State Building\" or \"Eiffel Tower\".\n* `political` indicates a political entity. Usually, this type indicates a polygon of some civil administration.\n* `postal_code` indicates a postal code as used to address postal mail within the country.\n* `premise` indicates a named location, usually a building or collection of buildings with a common name\n* `route` indicates a named route (such as \"US 101\").\n* `street_address` indicates a precise street address.\n* `sublocality` indicates a first-order civil entity below a locality. For some locations may receive one of the additional types: `sublocality_level_1` to `sublocality_level_5`. Each sublocality level is a civil entity. Larger numbers indicate a smaller geographic area.\n* `subpremise` indicates a first-order entity below a named location, usually a singular building within a collection of buildings with a common name",

All other addresses are returned in the preferred language. Address components are all returned in the same language, which is chosen from the first component.\n* If a name is not available in the preferred language, the API uses the closest match.\n* The preferred language has a small influence on the set of results that the API chooses to return, and the order in which they are returned.

Each session can have multiple queries, followed by one place selection. The API key(s) used for each request within a session must belong to the same GoMaps.pro Cloud Console project. Once a session has concluded, the token is no longer valid; your app must generate a fresh token for each session. If the `sessiontoken` parameter is omitted, or if you reuse a session token, the session is charged as if no session token was provided (each request is billed separately).\n\nWe recommend the following guidelines:\n\n- Use session tokens for all autocomplete sessions.\n- Generate a fresh token for each session. Using a version 4 UUID is recommended.\n- Ensure that the API key(s) used for all Place Autocomplete and Place Details requests within a session belong to the same Cloud Console project.\n- Be sure to pass a unique session token for each new session.

For example: `fields=formatted_address,name,geometry`. Use a forward slash when specifying compound values. For example: `opening_hours/open_now`.\n\nFields are divided into three billing categories: Basic, Contact, and Atmosphere. Basic fields are billed at base rate, and incur no additional charges.

Using a version 4 UUID is recommended.\n- Ensure that the API key(s) used for all Place Autocomplete and Place Details requests within a session belong to the same Cloud Console project.\n- Be sure to pass a unique session token for each new session.

GoMaps.pro often updates the supported languages, so this list may not be exhaustive.\n* If `language` is not supplied, the API attempts to use the preferred language as specified in the `Accept-Language` header.\n* The API does its best to provide a street address that is readable for both the user and locals. To achieve that goal, it returns street addresses in the local language, transliterated to a script readable by the user if necessary, observing the preferred language. All other addresses are returned in the preferred language. Address components are all returned in the same language, which is chosen from the first component.\n* If a name is not available in the preferred language, the API uses the closest match.\n* The preferred language has a small influence on the set of results that the API chooses to return, and the order in which they are returned. The geocoder interprets abbreviations differently depending on language, such as the abbreviations for street types, or synonyms that may be valid in one language but not in another.

For more information on the fields that are unavailable in a Place Search request, see <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-data-fields#places-api-fields-support\">Places API fields support</a>.</div>\n\nUse the fields parameter to specify a comma-separated list of place data types to return. For example: `fields=formatted_address,name,geometry`. Use a forward slash when specifying compound values. For example: `opening_hours/open_now`.\n\nFields are divided into three billing categories: Basic, Contact, and Atmosphere. Basic fields are billed at base rate, and incur no additional charges. Contact and Atmosphere fields are billed at a higher rate. See the [pricing sheet](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/pricing/sheet/) for more information. Attributions, `html_attributions`, are always returned with every call, regardless of whether the field has been requested.\n\n**Basic**\n\nThe Basic category includes the following fields: `address_component`, `adr_address`, `business_status`, `formatted_address`, `geometry`, `icon`, `icon_mask_base_uri`, `icon_background_color`, `name`, `permanently_closed` ([deprecated](https://developers.google.com/maps/deprecations)), `photo`, `place_id`, `plus_code`, `type`, `url`, `utc_offset`, `vicinity`.\n\n**Contact**\n\nThe Contact category includes the following fields: `formatted_phone_number`, `international_phone_number`, `opening_hours`, `website`\n\n**Atmosphere**\n\nThe Atmosphere category includes the following fields: `price_level`, `rating`, `review`, `user_ratings_total`.\n",

To achieve that goal, it returns street addresses in the local language, transliterated to a script readable by the user if necessary, observing the preferred language. All other addresses are returned in the preferred language. Address components are all returned in the same language, which is chosen from the first component.\n* If a name is not available in the preferred language, the API uses the closest match.\n* The preferred language has a small influence on the set of results that the API chooses to return, and the order in which they are returned. The geocoder interprets abbreviations differently depending on language, such as the abbreviations for street types, or synonyms that may be valid in one language but not in another.

To achieve that goal, it returns street addresses in the local language, transliterated to a script readable by the user if necessary, observing the preferred language. All other addresses are returned in the preferred language. Address components are all returned in the same language, which is chosen from the first component.\n* If a name is not available in the preferred language, the API uses the closest match.\n* The preferred language has a small influence on the set of results that the API chooses to return, and the order in which they are returned. The geocoder interprets abbreviations differently depending on language, such as the abbreviations for street types, or synonyms that may be valid in one language but not in another.

Using TypeScript, you can map low temperatures to blue colors and high temperatures to red to create a colorful image that's instantly understandable for visualizing temperature patterns.\n\nThis TypeScript code is designed to take special image files called GeoTIFFs and display them on a website using an HTML canvas (like a digital picture frame). The code uses the following components:\n\n- **GeoTIFF images:** GeoTIFFs can store multiple layers of image data, making them useful for maps or scientific analysis.\n    \n- **RGB Images:** These are the types of images we're most familiar with (like photos). Every pixel has red, green, and blue values that determine the color.\n    \n- **Palettes:** These are like paint sets. They contain a list of predefined colors that can be used to color images."
